# Introduction

This workshop provides a comprehensive guide on how to set up an Autonomous Transaction Processing Database, create an APEX application, and leverage Object Storage APIs in Oracle Cloud. In the labs, you will learn how to develop a web application that enables users to upload a sample project file to Object Storage and initiate a task for the project lead to complete. Additionally, you will walkthrough how to enable the project lead to download and review the project file and subsequently take action on their assigned task.

Estimated time: 75 minutes

*Note: This lab assumes you are using Oracle APEX 23.1.*
